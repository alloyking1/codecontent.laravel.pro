            Building your first MVP can be exciting — but also overwhelming. Many startups fall into common traps that slow them down or cause unnecessary setbacks.
          </p>
  
          <h2>1. Overcomplicating Features</h2>
          <p>
            Keep it simple. Your MVP should focus on solving one core problem, not every possible user request.
          </p>
  
          <h2>2. Skipping User Validation</h2>
          <p>
            Before you spend months building, talk to real potential users. Make sure the problem you think exists actually matters to them.
          </p>
  
          <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-blue pl-4 italic text-gray-600">
            "Build with the user, not just for the user."
          </blockquote>
  
          <h2>3. Ignoring Scalability Early</h2>
          <p>
            While you shouldn't overengineer, choosing flexible technologies like Laravel and MongoDB can save you huge headaches down the road.
          </p>
  
          <h2>4. Poor UX/UI Design</h2>
          <p>
            An MVP doesn't have to be ugly. Good design builds trust — even if the app is simple.
          </p>
  
          <h2>5. Launching Too Late</h2>
          <p>
            Perfect is the enemy of progress. Get a real version into users' hands, then iterate based on real feedback.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Remember: the goal of an MVP isn't to launch something "finished" — it's to learn fast and adapt quickly. 🚀
